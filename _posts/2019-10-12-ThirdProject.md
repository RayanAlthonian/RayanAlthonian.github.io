title: Metis Data Science Bootcamp - Project 3
---
In the fifth week of the bootcamp, we were given the instructions for the third project. In this project, the students were asked to create a classification model that classifies labels based on certain features. For instance, if the data of different crimes is provided, one can train a model to classify the different types of crimes based on, for example, the neighborhood name, time and date. This post will illustrate my approach to tackle this particular problem.

### Introduction
One of the most important pre-processing steps in some of image processing applications, like face detection and gesture recognition, is skin segmentation. Skin segmentation is challenging due to many areas of concern like the changing light intensity. My goal in this project is to take the different values of RGB colors of different pixels and classify them as skin pixels or non skin pixels.

### Methodology
The approach that i have followed is summarized in the following figure:

These steps will be discussed in detail in the following subsections.

#### Step 1: Data Collecting
The dataset, [skin segmentation dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/skin+segmentation), was taken from UCI repository. This dataset includes the RGB values of pixels that were taken from face pictures of people of different ages, ethnic groups and genders. Each pixel is labeled as as either a skin pixel or non-skin pixel.
