title: Metis Data Science Bootcamp Project 1
---

This post will about be the first project in Metis data science bootcamp

In the first week of the bootcamp, Metis intstructors teach basic data science
libraries like Numpy, Matplotlib, Pandas and Seaborn.

The first project is about doing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on NYC subway
data to provide a specific client with their needs which is done by using the
tools that weer taught in the first week of the bootcamp.

The client is an NGO called women tech, women yes (WTWY) which aims to empower
women in the technology sector. The client wants to invite people to a gala,
that is meant to support women in tech, in the beginning of summer, so they
asked us to determine the best possible times, days and stations in which their
street team is more likely to signup the maximum amount of people and hence
invite them to the gala.
